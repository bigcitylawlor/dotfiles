My dotfiles for zsh, fun times. No bash love, sorry.

===========================================================

Change your shell to zsh (all the cool kids are doing it):
	
	chsh -s /bin/zsh

===========================================================

Install like this:
	
	git clone git://github.com/tofumatt/dotfiles ~/code/dotfiles
	cd ~/code/dotfiles
	rake install

===========================================================

Update like this:
	
	c dotfiles
	git pull origin master

Your gitconfig and localrc will not be touched (they are only
setup on install).

===========================================================

A lot of this stuff is taken from Ryan Bates' dotfiles
(http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles). Both our dotfiles are
MIT-licensed, so use/reuse them or parts of them for
your enjoyment.
