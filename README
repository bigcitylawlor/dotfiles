My dotfiles for zsh, fun times. No bash love, sorry.
Install/update with rake install / rake update. Nice.

Includes:

  * awesome zsh completion/corrections
  * handy zsh functions (including git prompt info)
  * simple zsh aliases for common tasks
  * gitconfig with sane defaults and GitHub user info
  * sane global gitignore and gemrc
  * irbrc and built-in support for rvm

Obviously, you'll need Ruby, Rake, and git to install.
On most modern UNIX systems this shouldn't be an issue, or
it should be easy to install.

===========================================================

Change your shell to zsh (all the cool kids are doing it):
	
	chsh -s /bin/zsh

===========================================================

Install like this:
	
	git clone git://github.com/tofumatt/dotfiles ~/code/dotfiles
	cd ~/code/dotfiles
	rake install

===========================================================

Update like this:
	
	c dotfiles
	rake update

Your gitconfig and localrc will not be touched (they are only
setup on install).

===========================================================

A lot of this stuff is taken from Ryan Bates' dotfiles
(http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles). Both our dotfiles are
MIT-licensed, so use/reuse them or parts of them for
your enjoyment.
